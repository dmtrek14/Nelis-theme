# Nelis Theme Summary
This is a Bootstrap 4 theme for the Nevada Legislature's NELIS site, as well as some new menuing and other general improvements for the mobile experience of the site. Because there is a lot that has gone into the decisions around these things, I have decided to create some documentation detailing how those decisions were made, which can be found in the docs folder.
